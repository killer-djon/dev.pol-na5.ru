    <li><strong>Project selector</strong>: All issues are grouped by projects and tasks. Click and choose the project you wish to work with. Only issues linked to this project will be displayed. </li>
    <li><strong>Task selector</strong>: Tasks are linked to projects. Once you have a project selected, you can choose the task to work with. Only issues linked to this task will be displayed. </li>

    <li><strong>Add Issue</strong>: Click to open Add Issue dialog and create a new issue linked to the current task. </li>
    <li><strong>Filter pane</strong>: Select a filter to restrict visible issue list by a certain criteria, e.g. you can leave only issues assigned by you (or to you), recent issues added today or in last X days, etc. Filters are fully customizable and you can add your own filters. </li>
    <li><strong>Issue list</strong>: This is the main working area where you can browse the list of issues satisfied to selected filter, forward, edit, and organize filters, and etc. </li>

  <p>WebAsyst Issue Tracker allows you to track issue implementation from start to completion using a workflow mechanism based on states and transitions. For every project/task you can customize workflow separately.</p>
  <p>A sample of workflow diagram is shown below:</p>
  <p><img src="images/workflow.gif" /></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start</strong>:&nbsp; This is an initial point in every issue history.&nbsp;When you add a new issue&nbsp;you must expressly specify it's state from a list of available states defined by the project manager. In the workflow diagram sample shown above there is only one state, «In Progress», which you can set for a new issue. </li>
    <li><strong>States</strong>: In your workflow you can define as many states as you need to meet your business process requirements. In the sample above there are three states defined; e.g. In Progress, Done, and Final Approval. This might be a suitable workflow for a software bug hunting process: a/. A Tester locates a bug and adds a bug report (issue) In Progress state to Sue; b/. Sue fixes the bug and forwards the issue to Done state assigning this issue back to Tester (<sender /> in the diagram); c/. Tester checks implementation and forwards the issue further to Jeff for Final Approval. </li>
    <li><strong>Transitions</strong>: Workflow assumes that issues can be forwarded (transited) from one state to another. These possible transitions are shown on the diagram by arrows. In this sample one can send issue from In Progress state to Done only, from Done to Final Approval (default transitions designated by bold arrow) or back to In Progress, etc. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete</strong>: The final state for every issue. This state is mandatory for every workflow. There is no way to go further; i.e., Complete state in the workflow diagram can have only inward arrows and no outward arrows, nor can you assign a user at the Complete state. </li>

  <p>Click <strong>Tools -&gt; Workflow Manager</strong>. Select a project in the pull down menu and a task in the list below for which you want to customize workflow. Alternatively, you can click <strong>Customize Workflow</strong> link in the issue list located next to the task description.</p><blockquote dir="ltr" >
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Customizing workflow is the prerogative of the project manager or the user who has Full access rights to this project.</p></blockquote>
  <p dir="ltr">In the workflow diagram each state is designated by a rectangle with a name of state (status) inside, e.g. In Progress, Done, etc. Click a name of state to customize it or click <strong>Add State</strong> to open <strong>Define Workflow State</strong> form:</p>
  <p><img src="images/define-workflow-state.gif" /></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Place before</strong>: Defines relative position of the current state in your workflow sequence. </li>
    <li><strong>Status name</strong>: Brief description of the current state. </li>
    <li><strong>Can edit</strong>: Enable this flag if you want to permit issues in this state to be edited. In the issue list for issues in this state users will see Edit button. </li>
    <li><strong>Can delete</strong>: Enable this flag if want to allow deleting issues in this state. In the issue list for issues in this state users will see Delete button. </li>
    <li><strong>Assignment options</strong>: Select one of the following: 
      <ul >
        <li><strong>required/selectable</strong> - assignment is mandatory; user adding/forwarding issue into this state must select a person from the list of users assigned to the task </li>
        <li><strong>required/not selectable</strong> - assignment is mandatory and predefined in Assignee property as described below </li>
        <li><strong>not required</strong> - issue in this state can be assigned to a person but assignment is optional </li>
        <li><strong>not applicable</strong> - personnel assignment is not applicable </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Assignee (default)</strong>: Select user you want to assign by default to every issue in this state. Use &quot;sender&quot; option if you want to assign the user who has forwarded this issue from its previous state. 
      <p><u>Sample</u>: User James has created new issue in the state “In Progress” and assigned Sue. Sue has done her job and forwarded the issue to “Done”. If “Done” state has been designed to have &quot;sender&quot; as the default assignee, then Sue should not bother to assign someone when forwarding the issue to “Done”. James will be assigned by default as he was the &quot;sender&quot; of the original issue.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Color</strong>: This color will be used to display issues of this state in the issue list. </li>
    <li><strong>Allowed transitions</strong>: Select the states to which an issue from the current states are allowed. Click radio button for the state that should be default destination state for any transition from the current state. </li>
