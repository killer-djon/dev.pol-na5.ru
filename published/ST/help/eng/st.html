There are two basic methods of receiving requests.</p><p><strong>Method 1: via email</strong>. Your customers simply send their inquiries to a certain email address (or several addresses), and their requests will automatically appear in WebAsyst Help Desk. The operating principle of this method is similar to that of a regular email client; e.g., Outlook or Thunderbird. Messages are transferred from the mail server using the POP3 protocol and appear in the WebAsyst Help Desk request list.</p><p><strong>Method 2: via a web form</strong>. Your website visitors complete a simple form specifying their name, their email address to receive your response, request subject, and the text of the inquiry, then click the &quot;Send&quot; button. The message will be added to the WebAsyst Help Desk request list.<br /></p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="email-addresses"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h3>Setting up email addresses</h3><p>WebAsyst Help Desk allows you to create an unlimited number of email addresses for customer requests. To add a new address open section &quot;Settings -&gt; Email boxes&quot; and click the appropriate link on the right.</p><p>You can use two types of email addresses with WebAsyst Help Desk:</p><p><strong>Type 1: internal email address</strong> based on a domain name of <em>@youraccount.</em>, e.g., <em>support@youraccount.</em> or <em>help@youraccount.</em>. Such an internal email address can be created only by users of the WebAsyst Help Desk online services.</p><p><strong>Type 2: external email address</strong> located on any other mail server; e.g., <em>@yahoo.com</em> or <em>@gmail.com</em>.</p><p>Complete the following fields on the email address settings page.</p><p><u><strong>&quot;Name &amp; Email&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p><strong>Name</strong> will be used as the sender's name in your replies to customers' requests.</p><p><strong>Email</strong>: the email address you are setting up.</p><p><strong>Language</strong>: this language will be assigned as the default language to all new customers who send their first request to this email address. If you provide support to a multi-lingual audience, this setting will allow you to attach different email addresses to different languages; e.g., support@yourcompany.com can be attached to the English language and support@yourcompany.de â€” to German. The former of these addresses can be published on the English version of your company's website and the latter one on the German version. Customers who send requests to support@yourcompany.com would be considered English speakers and their &quot;Language&quot; setting would be automatically assigned the &quot;<em>English</em>&quot; value. This will make their personal online accounts appear in the same language.</p><p><strong>Incoming mail server</strong>. This settings group is available only for external email addresses (see type 2 above). Here you must specify the following connection parameters of the mail server.</p><p><strong>My mail server</strong>: POP3 or IMAP (the IMAP option is temporarily disabled in the current version).</p><p><strong>Server</strong> and <strong>Port</strong>: These values are usually provided by the administrator of the mail server where your email address is hosted. The port number is most often 110 for regular connections and 143 for secure SSL connections.</p><p><strong>Username</strong>: is almost always the same as the email address; the <strong>password</strong> is that which you use to connect to the mail box.</p><p><u><strong>&quot;Signature&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p>The signature is added at the end of each message which you send in response to customer requests from this address. As a rule, it contains the name and postal address of your organization, the telephone number of the support service, etc.</p><p>You may also add special template variables to the signature which will be automatically replaced with their actual values; e.g., the <em>MY_NAME</em> variable will be replaced with the name of the WebAsyst Help Desk user (support operator) who is sending a reply to the customer and the <em>REQUEST_LIST_URL</em> will become a link to the customer's personal online account.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Add links to your knowledge base and help section to the signature section so that customers can find useful information and answers to some questions. This will allow you to significantly reduce the number of queries sent to you by your customers.</p></blockquote><p><u><strong>&quot;Receipt&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p>The receipt is an auto-response which is sent to the customer after he/she has sent a new request to this email address.</p><p>After a new request is received, it is immediately assigned a unique number, and a notification is sent back to the customer. Such a notification (receipt) is not a required option, but it is advisable to utilize this option if your response time ranges from several hours to several days. Otherwise a customer may think that his/her request has been lost and will probably re-send it.</p><p>You may specify the estimated time of response and add useful links to the text of the receipt.</p><p>It is also recommended to specify a separate email address in the &quot;From&quot; field (e.g., <em>noreply@your_company.com</em> which you do not use for incoming mail) so that a reply of the customer to the receipt does not generate new requests in the queue.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Please keep in mind that the address which you decide to specify in the &quot;From&quot; field <strong>must exist on your mail server</strong>. If it does not, automatic receipts will be rejected as SPAM and will not be delivered to customers.</p></blockquote><p><u><strong>&quot;Anti-spam&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p>To protect yourself from SPAM, enable option &quot;Send automatic confirmation request on messages received from unknown addresses&quot;.</p><p>Any message from an unknown address will be treated as suspicious and an automatic confirmation request will be sent back to the sender. Such a request may contain a special link which must be clicked to confirm the sending of the request. To add such a link, ensure that the confirmation request contains the <em>REQUEST_CONFIRM_URL</em> variable. Add instructions for your customers, if necessary.</p><p>Enabling the anti-SPAM protection is not necessary if you employ other efficient means of protection or if you have published your email address on a website with limited access which is only visited by registered users.</p><p>Similar to receipts, it is advisable to send confirmation requests from a special email address like <em>noreply@your_company.com</em>.<br /></p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="web-forms"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h3>Setting up web forms</h3><p>Apart from email addresses, you can also receive customer requests from a request-sending form on your website. The form contains four fields: &quot;Your name&quot;, &quot;Email address&quot;, &quot;Request summary&quot;, and &quot;Request text&quot;. A request sent using such a web form will appear in the common request list of the WebAsyst Help Desk application â€” together with the requests sent by email.</p><p>To create a web form, open section &quot;Settings -&gt; Forms&quot; and click &quot;Create a new request form&quot;. A default web form will be immediately created and can be published on your website by one of the following methods (presented to the right of the form preview area).</p><p><strong>Simple link to the form</strong>. It is the easiest way to publish the form. A click on this link will open a new browser tab with the form.</p><p><strong>HTML to embed in website or blog (method 1: iframe)</strong>. A single line of code will allow you to embed the web form in any page of your website or blog. The drawback of this method is that you cannot fully control the appearance of the form, because only a limited set of design customization parameters is accessible on the web form settings page.</p><p><strong>HTML to embed in website or blog (method 2: javascript &amp; form)</strong>. The option for web developers; it allows you to apply any changes to the web form design and implement custom data pre-processing.</p><h3>Customizing web form</h3><p>Click the &quot;Customize&quot; link above the form preview area. The following adjustable properties are available to you:</p><p><strong>Form name</strong> at the top is displayed only to you and is not visible to website visitors.</p><p><u><strong>&quot;Fields&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p>All four fields are required; their names are editable.</p><p>Enable the <strong>CAPTCHA</strong> option to protect yourself from SPAM. This will add an image with several digits to the bottom of the form; website visitors will have to type those digits into a special text field to successfully send their request.</p><p><u><strong>&quot;Appearance&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p><strong>Caption</strong> is displayed at the top of the form. Change other design options if necessary: caption text and background color, sizes, caption of the sending button. These changes will only affect the appearance of the form if you decide to publish it as a <em>link</em> or as <em>iframe</em> (see description above) and are not applicable for the <em>javascript &amp; form</em> publication method because all styles and sizes are already available to you in the code.</p><p>Select the <strong>language</strong> in which diagnostic and/or error messages and field captions will be displayed to users.</p><p><u><strong>&quot;After submit&quot; tab</strong></u></p><p>Choose the behavior of the web form after a visitor sends a request to you:</p><p><strong>Stay on the form page and display this message</strong>. The message specified in the text area below will appear on the page after a request has been sent.</p><p><strong>Redirect to another page</strong>. Enter the URL of the page to which a website visitor will be redirected after sending a request.</p><p><strong>Email box from which return messages will be sent</strong>. Select one of the email addresses which you have set up in section &quot;Settings -&gt; Email boxes&quot;. Since the web form is not connected to any email address, this setting will allow you to specify the address from which replies will be sent to customer requests received from this form. The signature, the receipt, and the anti-SPAM protection feature which have been set up for the selected email address will be also applied to such requests.<br /></p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="requests-receiving-and-viewing"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h2>Receiving and viewing requests</h2><p>All messages received at the email addresses and submitted using web forms set up in the Settings section appear in a common request list.

The correct answer may not be obvious and may require consultations with specialists or a search of information in a help system or a knowledge base.
