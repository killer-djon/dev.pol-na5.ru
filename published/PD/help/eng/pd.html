WebAsyst Photos allows to arrange image files in albums, assign multi-user access to them and nicely publish your photos on the Internet.<br /></p><p>In the main screen of the WebAsyst Photos application the list of all available albums is displayed:</p><p><img src="images/album-list-500-en.jpg" /></p><h3>All images in WebAsyst Photos are arranged in albums.</h3><p>First create an album and then upload photos into it (note that a photo cannot be stored outside an album).</p><p>There is no hierarchy in the album list: all you have is a plain list of albums. An album cannot be nested inside another one.</p><p>The sorting order of albums is defined in the albums management mode; you can switch to that mode by clicking on the &quot;Manage albums&quot; link in the top right corner of the WebAsyst Photos main screen. Drag and drop albums to make them appear in the necessary order.</p><p>Physically albums are located in separate server directories, in which uploaded photos are stored.</p><p>WebAsyst Photos consists of two main parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Administration interface (backend).</strong> This part of the application requires users to authorize to enter a WebAsyst account. It is what you see when you are logged in and click on the &quot;Photos&quot; in the WebAsyst main menu at the page top.<br /><br />The administration mode offers users all available photos management tools: uploading new photos, creating albums, publishing albums etc. Access rights to individual albums and photos management screens are assigned individually for each account user. More details on assignment of access rights and collaboration are provided below in section &quot;Collaboration&quot;.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Publicly accessible interface (frontend).</strong> This is a part of the WebAsyst Photos application that does not require authorization and can be accessible by any Internet user.<br /><br />Example: <a href="http://demo./photos/">http://demo./photos/</a><br />The frontend contains only albums marked as published. Read more about publishing photo albums in section &quot;<a href="#publishing-photos">Publishing photos</a>&quot;.</li></ul></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="uploadingphotos-rus"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h2>

Such full size versions can only be accessed via special links generated in the backend if a user has access to the albums such photos are located in. The URLs of those links are virtually uncrackable (an attempt to crack them would make you &quot;guess&quot; a 32 character long hash code!).</p><p>After the upload (i.e. when the photo has been saved in a protected server directory) six thumbnails of different size are automatically generated for each photo:</p><ul><li>96*96 px (cropped),</li><li>144*144 px (cropped),</li><li>256*... px,</li><li>512*... px,</li><li>750*... px,</li><li>970*... px.</li></ul><p>Image size in the latter four cases is adjusted for the largest of the thumbnail dimensions to fit the specified limit (the 970 px limit was chosen so that the published albums could be correctly displayed on screens with the 1024*768 pixels resolution which may be used by your photo gallery visitors).</p><p>Thumbnails are used to display your photos in different modes: when you view a list of photos, publish them, send someone a link to your photo or export photos. Thumbnail files take up less server disc space than full size images and can therefore be much faster transferred over the Internet.</p><p>Thumbnail sizes are not adjustable, they are hardcoded in WebAsyst Photos and cannot be changed without modification of the PHP scripts.</p><p>The size of photos that can be uploaded to WebAsyst Photos is limited to 20 Mpx. If you purchase PHP scripts (as opposed to WebAsyst online service), the maximum photo size would only be limited by your server capabilities (first of all, the amount of memory available for PHP scripts).<br /></p><h3>Setting up thumbnails generation</h3><p>Photo thumbnails are generated by means of one of the following PHP extensions: <a href="http://www.php.net/imagick">Imagick</a> or <a href="http://www.php.net/gd">GD</a>. The extension that should be used can be chosen in WebAsyst Photos backend screen &quot;Settings&quot;.</p><p>If your server supports Imagick, we recommend using this option as it allows to achieve better results: <em>less memory is used, thumbnails are generated faster and have higher quality.</em> Read a detailed answer to question &quot;<a href="#support/help/gd-vs-imagick.html">Which is better: GD or Imagick?</a>&quot; in the WebAsyst Photos FAQ section<br /></p><p>Settings option &quot;Sharpen thumbnails&quot; allows to increase the quality of your photos thumbnails. Enabling it will automatically apply the sharpening filter when thumbnails are created. Enabling this option is a recommended setup.</p><p><img src="images/nosharpen-vs-sharpen-en.jpg" /><br /></p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="flickr-import"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h3>Import from Flickr</h3><p>WebAsyst Photos allows importing photos from a <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> account.</p><p>To import photos from Flickr, create a new or open an existing album and click on &quot;Import from Flickr&quot; in the right panel. On the page that opens click on &quot;Edit Flickr API settings&quot; and read detailed instructions on what is required to import photos (i.e. how Flickr API parameters should be correctly set up).</p><p>Once Flickr API settings have been entered, click on &quot;Import now&quot; and choose the photo set to be imported. WebAsyst Photos can only import photos from sets, therefore, if you have no sets available, create them before importing.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> WebAsyst Photos imports the <em>largest versions of uploaded photos from a Flickr account that Flickr server offers for import</em>. As a rule, those are 1024 pixel sized images, however, this may depend on your account settings and the actual image sizes.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="photos-backend"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h2>Photos management mode</h2><ol>
